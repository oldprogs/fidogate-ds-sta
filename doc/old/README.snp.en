List of changes after applying this patch:

(further in text: `config.h' == `${source_dir}/fidogate-X.X.X/config.h')


1. Corrected not recoding of headers while gating FTN->RFC and back.
   For the normal work of recoding the line `#define AI_5' in config.h
   should be uncommented.


2. Corrected error in AmigaDOS outbound processing. [*]


3. Disabled ^ACHRS É ^ACHARSET kludges recognition -- it is very rare that 
   they contain the correct message encoding. [*]

   To disable this feature comment out the line `#define SNP_IGNORE_CHRS'
   in config.h


4. Changed the processing of MIME headers while gating RFC->FTN and back.
   Specifically, now the messages that consist of several parts 
   (MIME type `multipart/mixed') are gated normally, and the FTN messages,
   which contain the `^aRFC-Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit' kludge, 
   are recoded.

   To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_MIME_FIX' in config.h


5. Corrected the recoding tables from cp866 to koi8-r and back.


6. Added the possibility to use wildcards (`*' symbol) in the file
   ${prefix}/etc/fidogate/aliases.

   To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_ADVANCED_ALIASES'
   in config.h

   Example:

	areafix		2:5020/1838.0		"Areafix"
	filefix		2:5020/1838.0		"Filefix"
	snp		2:5020/1838.0		"*"

   messages to Areafix @ 2:5020/1838 will be sent to the user areafix,
   messages to Filefix will be sent to the user filefix, messages to any other 
   name, which differs from these two, will be sent to the user snp. 
   When gating RFC->FTN the message from `"User" <snp>' will be transformed to 
   `User @ 2:5020/1838'
   Another example:

	areafix		2:5020/1838.0		"Areafix"
	filefix		2:5020/1838.0		"Filefix"
	snp		2:5020/1838.0		"Serge N. Pokhodyaev"
	snp		2:5020/1838.0		"*"

   the only difference is that when gating RFC->FTN the message from 
   `"User" <snp>' will be transformed to `Serge N. Pokhodyaev @ 2:5020/1838', 
   i.e. the name given in the config will be substituted.
   You can also disable the insertion of the ^AREPLYADDR É ^AREPLYTO kludges, 
   the lines `From:', `Reply-To:' and so on into the message body, if there 
   exists a corresponding alias for the RFC address. To do this you need to 
   put the keyword `NoFSC0035ifAlias' in config.


7. Added an automatic selection of AKA to be inserted into .pkt header and 
   to areafix and filefix answers. Recommended, if you have several AKAs
   in the same zone (in this case non-patched fidogate uses the first address
   for this zone, found in the address list.

   To disable this feature comment out `#define BEST_AKA' in config.h


8. Now you can disable `^ACHRS', `^ARFC' and `^AGATEWAY' kludges insertion 
   into FTN messages. Kludges are disabled by the config parameters
   (correspondingly) `NoChrsKludge', `NoRfcKludge', `NoGatewayKludge'.

   To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_DENY_SOME_KLUDGES'
   in config.h


9. Added the feature to correct the date in the letters "from the future". 
   Date is replaced by current, and the original date is stored in the header
   `X-Original-Date'.

   To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_FUTURE_DATE_FIX'
   in config.h


10. Added one more variant of RFC headers gating -- all, except some.
    Specifically, MIME headers are gated. This variant is enabled by 
    adding the line `RFCLevel 3' to config. Also implemented concatenation 
    of multiline RFC headers in a single line when gating RFC->FTN.
    
    To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_RFC_LVL_3_HEADERS'
    in config.h


11. Added invalidation of tearlines, origins and SEEN-BY's when gating 
    RFC->FTN.

    To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_INVALIDATE'
    in config.h


12. Now not only `^AVia' kludges are gated to RFC, but `^ARecd' kludges 
    as well.

    To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_RECD' in config.h


13. Now when gating FTN->RFC the X-Comment-To header is inserted, even if
    the letter was addressed to `All'.

    To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_X_COMMENT_TO'
    in config.h


14. Added possibility to gate non-standard kludges RFC->FTN and back.

    To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_X_FTN_KLUDGE'
    in config.h

    Gating FTN->RFC is enabled by adding a `K' symbol to the `X-FTN'
    parameter value in config. RFC->FTN gating is always enabled
    Example:

	FTN kludge			RFC header   

	^ARealName: Vasya Pupkin   <->	X-FTN-Kludge: RealName: Vasya Pupkin
	^AVeryLeftKludge	   <->	X-FTN-Kludge: VeryLeftKludge


15. Now you can (and have to) set the packing rules in the file 
    `${prefix}/etc/fidogate/packing' separately for netmail and echomail
    by using `Netmail' É `Echomail' keywords.

    To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_PACKING_FIX'
    in config.h

    Example:

	arc     zip     "/usr/bin/zip -9gkjq %s %s"

	EchoMail
	pack    noarc   2:5020/1838.0
	pack    zip     *

	NetMail
	pack    noarc   *


16. Added possibility to run FIDOGATE from a user other than `news'. To do this
    you need to apply a separate patch `fidogate-X.X.X-snpXX_ftnnews.diff',
    and then change the values of the OWNER and GROUP parameters in the 
    file ${source_dir}/fidogate-X.X.X/config.make 


17. Now you can define whether the bundles are truncated after transmissi9n,
    deleted or left intact. The action is controlled by the config parameter
    `BundleDisp <disp>', where <disp> can have values:
	    0 -- truncate bundle to zero length (`#' in .flo);
	    1 -- delete bundle (`^' in .flo);
	    2 -- leave bundle (`@' in .flo);
    Default value is `0'.

    To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_FILE_DISP'
    in config.h


18. Now when gating RFC->FTN RFC addresses of type 
    `user%host.name@f128.n50.z2.fidonet.org' are processed correctly.


19. [intentionally left blank]


20. Added `passive' mode of the link's subscription. In this mode echomail
    for the given link won't be packed, but the subscription information
    is retained and all the messages from the link to echoareas in passive mode
    are accepted. To put the echoes in passive, use areafix commands     
    `passive AREA' or `pause AREA'. To activate passive areas use commands 
    `active AREA' or `resume AREA'. Syntax of these commands is like that of 
    `subscribe' and `unsubscribe' commands, with only one difference -- if 
    `AREA' is not given, this is equivalent to a `*' template. Areas are also
    activated when subscribing them again.
    Passive links are denoted by `-p LIST' option in the areas.bbs and 
    fareas.bbs files. `LIST' argument format is fully equivalent to the 
    subscribed links list format, with the only difference -- the addresses
    are delimited by comma, not by space. For example:

	X 1838.TEST -p 2:5020/9999,9988 ...

    Addresses 2:5020/9999.0 and 2:5020/9988.0 are passive.

    To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_AF_PASSIVE'
    in config.h


21. Added possibility to set certain echoes and fileechoes for certain links
    `read only' and/or `mandatory' (can't unsubscribe or switch to passive). 
    Special file (${prefix}/etc/fidogate/ftnacl) used to control access. Every
    string of that file may contain acl type switch (`echo', `fecho',
    `mandatory', `readonly') or actual acl. Acl format follows:

	[!]addr[,[!]addr]...       [[!]area][,[!]area]....

    addr -- FTN address, area -- area name, wildcards allowed in both fields.
    `!' means rule inversion.

    Addresses may be in reduced form (as link list in areas.bbs).

    At first address is searched in address list. If matched -- 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To do this, `-r ACL' É `-m ACL' options are used
    in areas.bbs and fareas.bbs files. ACL is an address list, delimited
    by comma. Addresses can be also shortened (as in the links list). 
    `!' Symbol is also allowed, which inverts the restriction. The check is 
    done from left to right till first match. ACL examples (other options
    and the links list are replaced by dots):

	X HUMOR.FILTERED -r * ...		 // read only for everyone
	X N5020.SYSOP    -r !*/*.0,!1838.1,* ... // For all points, except
						 // 2:5020/1838.1 - read only
	X 1838.INFO      -m * -r * ...		 // Mandatory and read only
						 // for everyone

    Uplink (first address in the links list) is not affected by read only 
    mode. If you want uplink to be affected by read only mode, you need to 
    provide an `UplinkCanBeReadonly' parameter in fidogate.conf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If the point number is not given, it is assumed 0, i.e. `2:5020/*'
    equals to `2:5020/*.0'. But `*' equals to `*:*/*.*'.
    In the first rule you MUST provide a net number. I.e. the record like 
    `-r *.1' is incorrect, you must write at least `-r */*.1'. The record
    `-r *' is allowed, though.
    If the zone is not present in the first rule, the zone from `-z' and `-a'
    options is used. Example:

	X HUMOR.FILTERED -z 2 -a 2:5020/1838.0 -r 5020/*.* -d "" 2:5020/7100

    in this case `-r 5020/*.*' equals to `-r 2:5020/*.*', because zone 2 is 
    assigned for this echoarea.

    By default messages to read only areas are saved to `SPOOLDIR/toss/bad'
    directory. If you put a `KillReadonly' parameter in config, this messages
    would be deleted.

    To disable this feature comment out `#define SNP_FTN_ACL' in the file
    config.h


22. Now node addresses printed in origin and `Via' in a 3D format
    (i.e. z:n/f).
    (requested by Leonid Kilasoniya)


23. Now specific access mode 0600 is set for *.tic files.
    (requested by Vladimir Lyapkin)
    To disable this feature commet out the line 
    `#define SNP_SET_TICK_MODE' in config.h


24. Now ftninrecomb script is working, which assembles the messages,
    splitted by fidogate. A bug is also fixed in documentation:
    `FTNInRecombine' parameter should be written in this form:

	FTNInRecombine  %L/ftninrecomb

    ATTENTION: by default no assembly is made (FTNIn* parameters in config
    are commented out), but you are strongly advised to turn message 
    reassemling on (i.e. uncomment these parameters). In other case
    you can experience loss of messages, splitted by other fidogate.


25. If an RFC message contaiined `X-flags:' header with `m' parameter,
    an `^aREPLY' kludge is now added when gating RFC->FTN (in original
    fidogate this kludge is not added).
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_REPLY_IF_X_FLAGS_M' in config.h


26. Added possibility to put file descriptions not in `files.bbs', but in
    separate files <filename>.desc in a `.desc' subdirectory.
    (patch by Vladimir Lyapkin)
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_DESC_DIR' in config.h


27. Now an `X-FTN-From' RFC header is added to the gated echomail too.
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_X_FTN_FROM_ECHOMAIL' in config.h


28. Added decoding of MIME-encoded Subjects when gating RFC->FTN in the case,
    when the encoding is not `iso-8859-1'.
    (requested by Alexander V. Popaduck)
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_MIME_DECODE_HEADER' in config.h


29. Now zone and point numbers are not printed in the address output from the
    FTN message header (for example, pktdebug -m, or ftntoss messages
    `insecure echomail area ... from ...')


30. Zero size area prefixes in the areas file are now working. For example:

	""	ftn.		-8 -H -a 2:5020/1838

    means, that echoarea `ECHO.NAME' will be transformed into newsgroup
    `ftn.echo.name'.


31. Corrected original FIDOGATE error: if an incorrect password was given
    in an areafix request, the answer would be sent to the address -1:-1/-1

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_AF_BAD_PASSWD_FIX' in config.h


32. Added recognition of some additional RFC headers at the beginning of an
    FTN message (right now only `Subject:').

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_MORE_RFC_HDRS' in config.h


33. Corrected original FIDOGATE error: the digital part of MSGID length
    could exceed 8 symbols (which violates FTS-0009). (patch by Leonid
    Kilasoniya)


34. Corrected original FIDOGATE error: if an FTN message contained a line
    longer than 79 symbols, garbige could be inserted to RFC message
    when gating.


35. Corrected original FIDOGATE error: in sendmail/Makefile `make' was  
    called instead of $(MAKE) (bug found by Valentin Nechayev)


36. No empty line is inserted now before tearline. 
    (requested by Pavel V. Knyazev)
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_NO_CRLF_BEFORE_TEARLINE' in config.h


37. Added the feature "forward requests". When an attempt is made to 
    subscribe to echoarea (or fileechoarea), which doesn't exist in 
    areas.bbs/fareas.bbs, then a subscription request is sent to an uplink. 
    You can define several different uplinks for different echoarea groups.
    Settings are written in file `${prefix}/etc/fidogate/uplinks'. Example:

    # Robot type    Area pattern    Uplink          Robot name      Password
    # -----------   -------------   ----------      -----------     ---------
    af              !N5025.*,*      2:5025/3        AFix            test
    ff              !TEST.*,*       2:5025/5025     FileFix         xxxxxxxx

    Subscription request for any echo except `N5025.*' will be forwarded to 
    address `AFix @ 2:5025/3' with the password `test'.
    Subscription request for any echo except `TEST.*' will be forwarded to 
    address `FileFix @ 2:5025/5025' with the password `xxxxxxxx'.

    Besides that, every uplink address should have a corresponding record 
    in the file ${prefix}/etc/fidogate/hosts. For example:

    2:5025/3	f3.n5025.z2.fidonet.org.	-p
    2:5025/5025	f5020.n5025.z2.fidonet.org.	-p

    `-p' is mandatory.

    (patch by Oleg Derevenetz)

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_UPLINKS' in config.h


38. Added the feature "spy forwards".
    Settings are written in file `${prefix}/etc/fidogate/spyes'. For example:

    # FTN address   FTN address forward-to
    # -----------   --------------------
    2:5025/3.4      2:5025/3.7
    2:5025/3.0      2:5025/3.7

    (patch by Oleg Derevenetz)
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_SPYES' in config.h


39. Added possibility to announce new files, received by fileechoes.
    Announces are wrtten (koi8-r encoding) into file, the name of which you
    must put in <LIBEXECDIR>/ftntickpost after applying the patch ($ANNFILE
    variable).

    The announce looks like the following:

    File          Size       Area         Origin        From
    ============= ========== ============ ============= ======================
    leguin24.ha   16384      BOOK         2:5020/614.1  2:5083/21
                             Ursula Le Gwin. Some book name.  
    ==========================================================================
    ordar06.ha   787064     BOOK         2:5020/614.1  2:5083/21
                            Robert Jordan. Other book name.
    ==========================================================================


40. Added pid check in lock files. As a result, there is no more need to 
    periodically run runchklock script.
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_CHECK_STALE_LOCK' in config.h


41. Now ftnoutpkt can generate echomail. Echoarea is defined by `-A' option. 
    Example:

ftnoutpkt -f 'test @ 2:5020/1838.0' -s 'none' -A '1838.TEST' 'All' <test.txt

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_FTNOUTPKT_ECHOMAIL' in config.h

42. Added access restriction for the areafix %listall command. To allow a link
    execution of this command, put `%' symbol in the "key" field in the file 
    passwd. Example:

	af	2:5020/1838.8	PASSWORD	1	AB
	af	2:5020/1838.9	PASSWORD	1	%ABCD
    
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_AF_LISTALL_RESTRICTED' in config.h


43. Implemented change: passthru areas are gated, when our address is in the
    list of links, i.e. there is no need to put separate Address and
    GateAddress in fidogate.conf and the corresponding `remap ...' in
    ${prefix}/etc/fidogate/routing.
    (patch by Sergey Samoyloff)
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_FTNTOSS_NOPASSTHRU' in config.h


44. Added recoding of file descriptions from .tic in correspondence with
    DefaultCharset parameter value in fidogate.conf.
    (patch by Sergey Samoyloff)
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_RECODE_FILE_DESC' in config.h


45. Added changing the names of files, which were received by fileechoes,
    to lower case.
    (patch by Sergey Samoyloff)
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_CONVERT_FILENAMES_TO_LOWER' in config.h


46. Added ACL to restrict e-mail gating by RFC and FTN addresses. Because of
    this, ${prefix}/etc/fidogate/acl file format has changed, and a new 
    bounce template has been added -- bounce.acl_netmail.
    You can find the examples in fidogate-x.x.x/contrib/acl_netmail/ directory.
    (patch by Sergey Samoyloff)
    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_NETMAIL_ACL' in config.h


47. Added messages statistics for each echoarea (enabled by adding a line
    `TrafficStatistics' to fidogate.conf). Statistics are printed by ftntoss 
    to logfile after processing all .pkts. Example (the line is split in two
    for convenience):

Jun 09 06:20:45 ftntoss area \
Ru.Linux                           : msgs in: 2   out: 1   killed: 0/0/1/0/0
Jun 09 06:39:46 ftntoss area \
RU.UNIX                            : msgs in: 2   out: 2

    `killed: ...' field format: routed/insecure/dupes/circular path/readonly
    (the last number is printed, if FIDOGATE is compiled with `SNP_FTN_ACL'
    define)

    If the number of `in' and `out' messages is equal, `killed' field is not
    put to logfile.


48. Added recoding of .pkt that are generated by ftnoutpkt and ftnafpkt
    in correspondence with DefaultCharset parameter value in fidogate.conf.

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_RECODE_OUTPKT' in config.h


49. Added possibility to define in config the range of a last bundle extension 
    symbol. The range is defined by the parameter `LastArcmailChars'
    in the file ${prefix}/etc/fidogate/packing:

	0 -- use symbols [0-9]
	1 -- use symbols [0-9a-f]
	2 -- use symbols [0-9a-z]
	>2 -- use symbols from `0' till the symbol, the position number of 
              which in the line `0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
	      equals to the parameter value (for example, 17 -- 
              use symbols [0-9a-h]

    Example:

	LastArcmailChars  2
	arc     rar64   "/usr/bin/rar a -m5 -ep -s- -inul -md64 %s %s"
	arc     rar     "/usr/bin/rar a -m5 -ep -s- -inul -md1024 %s %s"

    (patch by Dmitriy Yermakov)

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_PACK_LASTCHAR' in config.h


50. Added possibility to limit arcmail size separately for each link 
    in the file ${prefix}/etc/fidogate/packing:

	pack    rar     size=500 2:5020/9999
	pack    zip     size=300 2:5020/9988

    The size is given in kilobytes. If size is not given, MaxArc parameter
    value from fidogate.conf is used.
    (patch by Dmitriy Yermakov)

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_PACK_MAXARC' in config.h


51. Corrected original FIDOGATE error -- when running ftnaf from command line,
    level and key were not read from ${prefix}/etc/fidogate/passwd.

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_AF_AUTH_FIX' in config.h


52. Implemented changes in echoarea handling.

    Now when subscribing to echoarea, ftnafutil sets a `W' status to it. 
    This status is changed to `S' by ftntoss when messages appear in echoarea.

    Added areas.bbs option `-t TIME', which shown the time when ftntoss 
    processed the latest message for this area (if status is `-s S'), or time,
    when an unsubscribe request was sent to uplink (if status is `-s U'), or
    time, when a subscribe request was sent to uplink (if status is `-s W').

    Because of these changes, areas.bbs file is rewritten by ftntoss during
    each run.

    Changed the "forward request" function (see section 37 of README): now   
    the area, for which a request was sent, is created (with `F' status) 
    and a link that tried to subscribe to it, is now subscribed. The uplinks
    file format was extended for this: added sixth field where you can put 
    the options to create area with. For example:

	af	*	2:5020/3500	AreaFix	   PASSWORD	-# -k AKX

    Access restriction options (`-k' É `-l') are applied -- if link's access
    is limited, no request is sent to uplink.

    To prevent requesting areas like `Hello', `Bye' and so on :) from uplinks,
    `AreaFixSubscribeOnlyIfPlus' parameter is added to fidogate.conf -- if 
    given, subscription is only made by command `+<area>'.

    Added `expire' command of ftnafutil utility. By using this command all
    downlinks are unsibscribed (and notified via netmail), and an unsubscribe 
    request is sent to uplink, concerning the areas that didn't have traffic
    for some time (controlled by `AreaFixNoTrafficTimeout' parameter (in days)
    of fidogate.conf), or the areas that were requested from uplink, but no
    messages appeared in them during some period of time (controlled by 
    `AreaFixRequestTimeout' (in days) of fidogate.conf). If an area had `F'
    status, it is deleted.

    By default the parameter values for `AreaFixNoTrafficTimeout' and
    `AreaFixRequestTimeout' equal 0, i.e. timeout checking is disabled.

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_AF_IMPROVEMENTS' in config.h


53. Changed action of %list command -- now it outputs only areas, subscribed
    from uplinks (i.e. areas with `S' or `W' status).
    Added areafix command %avail, which outputs the list of areas, which are
    not subscribed from uplinks, or all areas (equivalent to the old action
    of %list command), if `AreaFixAvailPrintsAllAreas' is given in the file 
    fidogate.conf.
    (requested by Oleg Artemjev)

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_AF_AVAIL' in config.h


54. Added `a' flag of `X-Flags' RFC header, which allows to set `ARQ' 
    (audit request) flag in a gated to FTN message.
    (requested by Valery Shishkov)

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_X_FLAGS_A' in config.h


55. Added the feature to autocreate echoareas while tossing.

    When processing a message to an unknown area, first the .pkt password is
    checked against the password in configs. This check can be disabled by 
    putting `AutoCreateDontCheckPassword' keyword in fidogate.conf.

    Then it is checked if a link is allowed to create echoareas (i.e. if there
    is a `&' symbol in the "key" field of "af" context in file
    ${prefix}/etc/fidogate/passwd)

    Then it is checked if the area is allowed to be created. It can be 
    forbidden by fidogate.conf keywords `AreaFixCreateForbiddenAreas' and 
    `AreaFixCreateForbiddenAreasFile'; this is also applied to %create
    areafix command. Each parameter may be used several times. Example:

	AreaFixCreateForbiddenAreas *UUE*
	AreaFixCreateForbiddenAreas RU.DRUGS
	AreaFixCreateForbiddenAreasFile /var/spool/fido/misc/fidokill.na
	AreaFixCreateForbiddenAreasFile /var/spool/fido/misc/stopareas

    To specify forbidden areas, shell-style wildcards can be used
    (`*', `?', `[...]', `[^...]').
    In the files, containing the templates of forbidden areas, only symbol
    sequences from the beginning of line till first space or tabulation 
    symbol are recognized. I.e. lines

	TALES.FROM.CRYPTKEEPER - Description missing -
	TALKS.ASM            Low-level programming
	TBBS                 - Description missing -
	*.UUE			All UU echoes

    are fully equivalent to the lines

	TALES.FROM.CRYPTKEEPER
	TALKS.ASM
	TBBS
	*.UUE

    Then, if the area passed all the above checks, it is created. You can  
    specify the options to be created with in fidogate.conf. For example:

	AutoCreateLine -# -s S

    After that, if AutoCreateNG keywork is specified in fidogate.conf, the 
    corresponding newsgroup will be created (in correspondence with the file
    ${prefix}/etc/fidogate/areas). To do this, a news user suid binary ngoper
    is called (located in ${prefix}/lib/fidogate/bin/).
    For it's normal work you need to provide `AutoCreateNewgroupCmd',
    `AutoCreateRenumberCmd' and `AutoCreateRmgroupCmd' parameters, for example:

	AutoCreateNewgroupCmd	/usr/bin/ctlinnd newgroup %s
	AutoCreateRenumberCmd	/usr/bin/ctlinnd renumber %s
	AutoCreateRmgroupCmd	/usr/bin/ctlinnd rmgroup %s

    There is a possibility to automatically subscribe certain addresses to
    a created area, for example:

	AutoCreateSubscribeNodes 2:5020/1838.0 .1 .1838

    There is a possibility to write the names of all created areas 
    (automatically as well as by %create areafix command) to a specific file;
    to do this specify it's path in fidogate.conf:

	AreaFixCreateAnnounceFile /var/spool/fido/misc/newareas

    Every line in the file looks like "<arename> <node> <unix_time>", example:

	AREA.FOR.TEST 2:5020/9999.0 961289549

    A create_announce script is added to fidogate-x.x.x/contrib/ directory,
    which posts the messages about created areas.

    (based on the patch by Sergey Samoyloff)

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_AUTOCREATE' in config.h


56. Added possibility to cofigure tick flavor for each address independently.
    To allow this, ${prefix}/etc/fidogate/routing file format is extended.
    A "tick" keyword is added (in addition to "netmail" and "echomail"). 
    Only "send" command is used for flavor description, any other command 
    is ignored.
    Example:

	NetMail
	send    hold    2:5020/1838.0
	route   normal  2:5020/278.0    2:* 1:* 3:* 4:* 5:* 6:*
	Echomail
	sendmove        hold    2:5020/1838.0
	sendmove        normal  *
	Tick
	send    hold    2:5020/1838.* 2:5020/9999
	send    normal  *

    If no flavor is given in any command for some address, then `TickFlav' 
    parameter value from fidogate.conf is used.

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_TICK_FLAV_CONF' in config.h


57. Now MSGIDs of all insecure messages are not added to dupes database.

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_INSECURE_DONT_PUT_INTO_DUPE_DB' in config.h


58. Now lock files are created when working with (f)areas.bbs. ftntoss, 
    ftnaf, ftnafpkt and ftnafutil create lock ÆÁÊÌ before reading 
    (f)areas.bbs and remove it before finishing of their work. If a lock file
    already exists and contains pid of an existing process, ftntoss and 
    ftnafutil stop with exit code 2. ftnaf and ftnafpkt wait until lock file
    disappears. Lock files have the same path and name as (f)areas.bbs 
    with the `.lock' extension.

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_LOCK_AREAS_BBS' in config.h


59. For the security reason enabled additional addresses checking in the  
    .pkt header, message header, origin and echomail ^aPATH.

    If the last address in PATH is not equal to address in the pkt header, 
    then the address from the pkt header is inserted into PATH.

    The following fidogate.conf keywords were added to control other checks:

    CheckNoOriginAddr: controls checking address in origin, and can have 
    values:
	0 -- use address from message header as an origin address (behavior
	     of original fidogate);
	1 -- if a message doesn't contain address in origin, and pkt header
	     contains a point address, then message is considered insecure
	2 -- if a message doesn't contain address in origin, and pkt header
	     contains any address, then message is considered insecure
    Absence of this parameter in fidogate.conf equals it's presence with the
    value of 0.

    CheckMsgHdrAddr: if specified, then if origaddr in pkt header differs
    from origaddr in the message header, then the message is considered
    insecure.

    CheckPointOriginAddr: if specified, and if the pkt header contains
    a point address different from address in origin, then the message is 
    considered insecure.

60. Now Via lines generated by FIDOGATE contains "\r" instead of "\r\n" at the
    end of line.


61. Added possibility to disable setting time of file received from fileecho
    to .tic's one
    To disable add parameter `TickDontSetTime' to fidogate.conf
    (patch by Dmitry Budanov)

    To disable this feature comment out the line
    `#define SNP_TICK_DONT_SET_TIME' in config.h
