This directory contains the sendmail m4 configuration file from the
RedHat 4.1 (Vanderbilt) / sendmail 8.8.5 release with some additional
config files for FIDOGATE support (tested on sendmail 8.8.5 - 8.12.0 version).

See cf/*.mc for a sample setup with FIDOGATE.

README		is the original README describing the m4 config in detail


If you only want to copy the FIDOGATE specific files to you own
sendmail m4 configuration tree, these are:

mailer/ftn.m4	FIDOGATE ftn mailer definitions (ftn, ftni, ftna, ftno)
cf/*		various example config files, mailertables etc.
